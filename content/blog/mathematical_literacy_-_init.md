message excerpt:
[02/12/2025, 23:27] i want to get like mathematically literate if that makes sense
[02/12/2025, 23:27] im thinking of like doing --'s cambridge stuff and i found notes that should match with their syllabi
[02/12/2025, 23:28] i dont think i wanna pursue math as a career but yea
```

## stuff
- [tripos syll.](/pdf/tripos-guide-merged.pdf)

# part I-A
### differential equations
i haven't had a proper course on it ever, just JEE stuff and we'll have our math3 course in 2-1 (read 2nd year, 1st semester)

rsrcs:
- boyce
- MIT 18.03


** i think i really enjoy differential equations quite a bit so this should be really fun

### groups
i didn't cover the entire [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLX2fVLMrzfneWeaqkufP2lRixEnLNiSNa) i was doing back in july, nor do i think ill have formal education on it during my degree


rsrcs:
- pinter or armstrong
- hlom
- the course on the playlist

### numbers and sets
i don't have any particular opinions on this? this was covered pretty okayish during jee prep but i feel like this is one of the most important foundation blocks of math so i need to cover it in depth pretty sure uepyep

rscrs:
- i intend to use velleman

### vectors and matrices
i have covered gilbert strangs linear algebra course for funsies during jee prep and will also be having linalg as my only math course in my 1-2 so i dont think i need to do much in it other than revision and notes and those sheets :thumbsup:

### probability and statistics
i have had a course on PnS this sem, but again thats basically from an engg pov so idk
ive done my course work from:
- lecture slides
- milton
- devore

i will try to do it again from a more mathematical pov,if i feel like it but im not too sure yepyep

rsrcs:
- sheldon ross
- mit 6.041

### multivariable calc
i have had a course on this too this sem, and i think im pretty ok w it,
i have done my course work from:
- lecture slides
- thomas

i do know that its just application based mvc and not really theoretically solid and proof based so ill brush that up with smth

rscrs:
- schaum

### dynamics and relativity
i have done a good amount of physics during jee, and will be having to deal with relativity in my coursework coming on so ill probably will be skipping this section

i might just do a bit of relativistic physics from somewhere but yeah not too keen on doing it rn

### analysis
okay i practically have 0 toes wet in this and hence 0 prior opinions/knowledge

i have heard a lot about baby rudin and abott in circles sooo

rsrcs:
- abott
- rudin

### easter sem
sooo i only want to do optimisation, hamiltonian, lagrangian (i did a bit of it during jee), and maybee computational projects

idrk about this but yea we shall see
